# Simple MQTT Client

The PAHO MQTT client libraries are a bit complex to use when needing a simple MQTT client process.

For this reason this library wraps all the complex stuff in a simple class and make it a walk in the part to implement an MQTT client that can subscribe and publish.

Only limitation is that this client can subscribe to only a single topic.
